Cross environment configuration scripts for Jetson TK1

# How-to:
First, you have to run `copy-rootfs.sh` script to make local copy of Jetson's headers, libraries etc. You'll find some variables in the top of script, which may need adjusting for your particular system. High capacity drive for rootfs and toolchain are recommended (TODO: how much exactly).
